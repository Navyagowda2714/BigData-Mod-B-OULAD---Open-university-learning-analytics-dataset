Open University is a public British University that also has the highest number of undergraduate students in the UK.
It is the largest academic institution in the United Kingdom (and one of the largest in Europe) with 2 Million enrolled students since it is established at 1969. 
As can be understood from its name, Open University mainly populated by off-campus students.
Content
This dataset belongs to Open University Online Learning Platform (Also called as "Virtual Learning Environment(VLE)") that off-campus students use for accessing the course content, 
forum discussions, sending assessments and checking out assignment marks etc. It consists of 7 selected courses (mentioned as modules in the dataset).
Different presentations indicated with letters "B" and "J" after year for semester 2 and semester 1 respectively.
Additionally, the dataset includes student demographics such as location, age group, disability, education level, gender etc.Student assessment marks,
interactions with the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) are also included.

Conclusion:
Best Model for Regression Task  - Support Vector
The best model for the regression task was support vector (RMSE = 18.4, SD = 0.2 with 4-fold cross-validation) which gave us RMSE = 18.1 and adjusted R2 = 0.63 when evaluated on the test set.
This is without any fine-tuning of the hyperparameters. 

Best Model for Classification Task â€“ Random Forest Classifier
Random forest classifier model performed the best. Althrough its accuracy scores (0.64, SD = 0.002) .
